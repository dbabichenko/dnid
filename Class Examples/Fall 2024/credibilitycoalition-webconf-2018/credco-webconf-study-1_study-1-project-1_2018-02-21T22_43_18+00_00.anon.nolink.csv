1083,7799,Six Pharmaceutical Drugs That Immediately Destroy Your Health,2017-12-07 01:18:51 UTC,"Some pharmaceutical medicines can cause you immediate physiological damage, keep reading to find out which ones! A new CDC report confirmed that half of all Americans take some pharmaceutical drug for their sicknesses. Over 150 million citizens in the U.S. are consuming medications that are tests or even unproven products. This is alarming since taking so much medication can cause many health-threatening problems in the human body. The number of Americans who take medication increased 10% since the early 1990s. It used to be illegal for pharmaceutical companies to push legal drugs onto people, but now with the rise in drug advertisements the number of people using them has snowballed. If you feel caught up in the pharmaceutical drug web, then you should ask yourself if taking a pill to mask symptoms based on bad lifestyle choices is the right way to go. Also, consuming pharmaceutical drugs will not cure your illness.

This isn't an uncommon practice; most flu vaccines pass inspection every year. It's well known advice that has been passed down from doctor to patient that the flu vaccine is something that we all should get, but it has been quickly surfacing that what's in the vaccines--especially those from 2015 and after--might actually be more damaging then simply rolling the dice on getting the flu. The ingredient that is getting the most flack is called an adjuvant. The particular one involved is called Squalene, and it has been linked to auto-immune disease side effects. In fact, it may have been used during chemical attacks in the Gulf War. Symptoms include chronic fatigue, muscle aches, and neurologic damage. While it may be a contested subject, it remains that we aren't really sure what's going into these vaccines we're being convinced should be used.
